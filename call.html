        <h5 class="theme-color">Workshop Goals</h5>
        <p> Visual analytics (VA) systems combine computational support and human cognitive and perceptual skills to
          explore and analyze data.
          Many of these systems have been incorporating machine learning (ML) models and algorithms to introduce some
          level of automation to the analytical process.
          However, within this relationship, there are a number of aspects that can impact the effectiveness of the
          human-machine teaming, including:
        <ol>
          <li> People's domain and system expertise;</li>
          <li> Human biases, including cognitive and perceptual biases;</li>
          <li> Trust in ML models and visual representation of data.</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- (1) people's domain and system expertise, (2) human biases, including cognitive and perceptual biases, and (3) trust in ML models and visual representation of data. -->
        Expertise, bias, and trust are intrinsically intertwined.
        Additionally, visual analytics systems are used in different fields and by people from various backgrounds, with
        different levels of domain expertise and experience with machine learning and visual analytics tools.
        This variety of experience and domain expertise among human users has opened the door for new research
        directions and challenges in the fields of visual analytics and machine learning.
        Designers who fail to consider the aforementioned diversities might introduce problems to the analysis
        effectiveness and user experience.
        Furthermore, experience and domain expertise might affect user trust in visual analytics tools; although, how
        and why they affect trust is still an open question.
        Trust will eventually affect how much the users would rely on and use the tool.
        While users will take advantage of their prior experiences to make better decisions with the assistance of
        analytic support, they might carry many cognitive biases that can negatively influence their decision-making or
        analysis process.
        Recent research shows trust in and reliance on the visual analytics systems/tools as well as user strategies and
        biases can be directly influenced by domain and system expertise (or lack of expertise).
        The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to
        discuss and discover challenges in ML supported visual analytics tools and set the stage for future research
        directions and collaborations regarding these issues by proposing design guidelines, empirical findings, and VA
        techniques.

        <br>
        <h5 class="theme-color">Topics of Interest</h5>
        <p>Workshop suggested topics are as followed:
        <ol>
          <li>Trust considerations based on different areas of domain expertise (e.g., medical, security, scientific,
            financial domains).</li>
          <li>Trust and bias considerations based on different levels of user familiarity with machine learning and
            visual analytics systems.</li>
          <li>Detecting and preventing cognitive biases in visual analytics and machine learning for users.</li>
          <li>User trust in machine learning models and visual explanations of model decisions in visual analytics
            systems.</li>
          <li>The correlation between trust, domain knowledge, and potential cognitive biases.</li>
          <li>The relationship between domain expertise and trust with model transparency, human interpretability, and
            model understandability in visual data analysis.</li>
          <li>The relationship between model interpretability, domain expertise, and trust.</li>
          <li>Human-centered considerations in Human-in-the-loop visualization tools and interpretable models.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="theme-color">Contribution Types</h5>
        <p>
          We are looking for and open to diverse forms of research (as listed below) within the realm of VA and ML with
          appropriate emphasis and relation to human trust, expertise, and cognitive factors.
          We encourage submissions of research involving:
        <ol>
          <li>Human empirical research/findings</li>
          <li>Design guidelines and surveys</li>
          <li>Technique papers</li>
          <li>Position papers</li>
          <li>Case studies</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="theme-color">Submission Format</h5>
        <p>The workshop will accept papers with 2 to 6 pages in length, plus 2 pages of references.
          All submissions must be in <b>IEEE VGTC Conference Style Template format </b>.
          (You can download the appropriate templates <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html">
            here</a>.)
          <!-- <br> -->
          <br>
          We also encourage authors to submit a short 30-second video of their work (for publication purposes) when
          submitting their work, if applicable.
          Depending on the conference format this year (i.e., virtual or hybrid), the authors of the accepted papers
          might be required to submit a longer video (e.g., 5 to 10 minutes) to substitute a live presentation.
          In such event, we will send further instructions closer to the workshop.
          <!-- For the camera-ready deadline, all the poster submissions <b>must</b> prepare a 30-second video for the poster fast-forward session. -->
          <!-- These videos might have audio for the archival purposes, but the authors will only use the video as a visual tool while presenting their fast-forward in the workshop. -->
          The submissions are made through the PCS (<a
            href="https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?next=https%3A//new.precisionconference.com/submissions">Precision
            Conference Solutions</a>) website.
          At least one author from each accepted paper needs to register for the conference (please refer to the <a
            href="http://ieeevis.org">IEEE VIS Website</a> for the registration requirements).
          The submissions are <b>not</b> required to be anonymize, and may include the full name of authors, their
          email, and affiliation as well as an acknowledgment.
          <br>
        <h5 class="theme-color">Publication</h5>
        <p> The workshop accepts papers in two formats, as seen below. Upon submitting the papers, authors are asked to
          determine their desired paper format.
        <ol>
          <li><b class="theme-color">Archival Short paper publication</b> through IEEE Xplore. This means that the
            papers can only be published in a proper journal as an extended version with at least 30% new content. This
            means each paper will be published and available through IEEE Xplore with an assigned DOI and are citable.
            While the papers published with this format can be extended to a journal publication (with 30% new content,
            subject to the rules of that journal), this content cannot be re-used for a future conference submission,
            such as IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and CHI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b class="theme-color">Short paper statements or Work-in-progress notes</b>, which will be non archival. In
            other words, the authors maintain the copyright of their paper and are allowed to reuse their material in
            future publications.
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="theme-color">Review Strategy</h5>
        <p>As the first step, a member of the organization team will go through the abstracts of all the submissions,
          and will assign a maximum of two members of the organization team to each paper based on how relevant the
          paper is to their expertise and research focus.
          Each paper will then be reviewed by their assigned internal reviewer(s).
          If the publication is relevant to the focus of the workshop, we would then ask an external reviewer (from a
          selective program committee) to review the paper as well.
          All the reviewers would assign a rating from 1 to 5 to denote the quality and relevance of the paper.
          Based on the final ratings of these papers, we will choose which papers will be accepted for the main
          conference presentation and which would be accepted for the poster presentation.
          Evidently, some of the papers might get rejected based on their relevance, quality, and research validity and
          value.
          The authors of the accepted <i>posters</i> are given an opportunity to give a short presentation of their
          poster during the workshop to promote their research and encourage participants to attend the poster session.
          Each paper would receive a light feedback, and if accepted, the authors can address the feedback in the
          camera-ready version.
